# rag chatbot

A functional RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot that processes PDF inputs to answer user questions.

## Features
- **PDF Ingestion:** Easily upload PDF documents for processing.
- **Question Answering:** Ask questions about the content of your PDFs and get accurate, context-aware answers.

## How it Works
The chatbot utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine the power of large language models with external knowledge from your uploaded PDFs. When a question is asked, relevant information is first retrieved from the processed PDF, and then used to augment the language model's response for more precise and informed answers.
